## 🚀Advanced Usage
**🧑‍💻Scripting**
PlantCare supports scripting to automate plant care tasks, helping users manage their plant collections more efficiently. Scripts can be used to automate tasks like updating watering schedules, sending reminders, or adjusting care routines based on plant health data.

**example**
script that automatically updates the watering status of plants based on the last watering date. If a plant hasn't been watered for more than 7 days, the script will mark it as "Needs Watering."

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta 
 plants = get_all_plants() 
 for plant in plants: 
 last_watered = datetime.strptime(plant['last_watered'], "%Y-%m-%d")
  today = datetime.today() 
  if today - last_watered > timedelta(days=7): 
  plant['watering_status'] = 'Needs Watering'
   update_watering_status(plant['id'], 'Needs Watering') 
   else:
    plant['watering_status'] = 'Well Watered' 
    update_watering_status(plant['id'], 'Well Watered')
     print("Watering statuses updated based on last watering date!")
```
